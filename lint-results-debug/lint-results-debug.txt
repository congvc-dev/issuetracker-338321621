/Users/congvc/StudioProjects/SAMPLES/MyApplication/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:18: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

/Users/congvc/StudioProjects/SAMPLES/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapp/Foo.kt:16: Error: remember calls must not return Unit [RememberReturnType from androidx.compose.runtime]
    val viewModelStoreOwner = remember(navBackStackEntry) {
                              ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RememberReturnType":
   A call to remember that returns Unit is always an error. This typically
   happens when using remember to mutate variables on an object. remember is
   executed during the composition, which means that if the composition fails
   or is happening on a separate thread, the mutated variables may not reflect
   the true state of the composition. Instead, use SideEffect to make deferred
   changes once the composition succeeds, or mutate MutableState backed
   variables directly, as these will handle composition failure for you.

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
