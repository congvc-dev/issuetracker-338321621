        severity="Error"
        message="`remember` calls must not return `Unit`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="3"
        summary="`remember` calls must not return `Unit`"
        explanation="A call to `remember` that returns `Unit` is always an error. This typically happens when using `remember` to mutate variables on an object. `remember` is executed during the composition, which means that if the composition fails or is happening on a separate thread, the mutated variables may not reflect the true state of the composition. Instead, use `SideEffect` to make deferred changes once the composition succeeds, or mutate `MutableState` backed variables directly, as these will handle composition failure for you."
